## Paper Mal King

Paper Mal King is simple Discord bot which main function is to automatically track and post it's users updates on MyAnimeList.  
Bot uses [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus) for interacting with Discord, [Jikan.Net](https://github.com/Ervie/jikan.net) wrapper for [jikan](https://jikan.moe/) for interacting with [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net).  
Bot is designed to work on few Discord guilds, and i don't want to share my instance for public, so if you want to use it, you will need to selfhost it, it's not that hard though, just follow instructions in [wiki](https://github.com/N0D4N/PaperMalKing/wiki).  
Notice that bot hasn't been tested in non-Windows environment and yed and hasn't any instructions how to host bot in it, still instructions should not be much different from instructions for Windows. I'll update wiki as soon i'll test bot on Linux.  
  
I'm pretty sure there are many English mistakes in code or in wiki so i'll much appreciate any help with proper translation so feel free to open an issue or pull request.
